# My gamer side

I have played many games in my life, I admit it. Fortunately I played brain developing games also!

I will be classifying them according to Platform/Store. The list here shows only those which I have completed (Main game + DLCs). Not what I own actually. That would be a very big list üò¨.

There might be a case of games, which are endless in nature. So I will try to mention them as well. I'm skipping online games. They are naturally endless type.

I will try to mention the dates as well wherever possible.

## Unofficial

(In other words, cracked games. I think they too deserve attention. Those are also great games. By default I will mention the official links. Else EGS, Steam, GOG or DRM free version Links if possible. But in no way I will be mentioning any crack links. Game Developers also need to earn money. I didn't have any hence I resorted to cracks.)

## I'm skipping

By default I skip sandbox games, because those tend to not have a story. And I skip online games too, because Online & cannot speed run to complete.
I also skip card games, as they are too long. The other games listed here are those I'm totally skipping.
