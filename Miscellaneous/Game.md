# My gamer side

I have played many games in my life, I admit it. Fortunately I played brain developing games also!

I will be classifying them according to Platform/Store. The list here shows only those which I have completed (Main game + DLCs). Not what I own actually. That would be a very big list üò¨.

There might be a case of games, which are endless in nature. So I will try to mention them as well. I'm skipping online games. They are naturally endless type.

I will try to mention the dates as well wherever possible.
