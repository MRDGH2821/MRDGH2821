### Brief Info About myself

Greetings, I'm Mihir Rabade, Currently studying at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune. I'm an Introvert & an enthusiast about technology, especially in Gaming sector. Earlier I was more fascinated about front end of things. But once I went behind the scenes, I became interested in Game Development. For now I have started with a 2D Side Scroller project.
Simply learning didn't help me unless I applied it, therefore I have a tendency to apply the knowledge I learnt.
