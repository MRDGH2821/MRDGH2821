# My gamer side

I have played many games in my life, I admit it.
Fortunately I played brain developing games also!

I will be classifying them according to Platform/Store.
The list here shows only those which I have completed (Main game + DLCs).
Not what I own actually. That would be a very big list 😬.

There might be a case of games, which are endless in nature.
So I will try to mention them as well.
I'm skipping online games. They are naturally endless type.

I will try to mention the dates as well wherever possible.

## Completed Games

`Included` = DLC play time is included in Main story play time.
The times are in `hhh:mm`.

Some games actually don't have a number in their title name,
like `Assassin's Creed 6: Unity`.
The numbers are put to match their release date.

Some of the games with start dates are determined from first achievement,
wherever it made sense.

## Others

In other words, games from the High Seas. I think they too deserve attention.
Those are also great games.
By default I will mention GOG, DRM free or Official Links if possible.
But in no way I will be mentioning Sea Ports of the High Seas.
Game Developers also need to earn money.
I didn't have any hence I resorted to the High Seas.
Considering my backlog of 1k+ games, I'm not buying new games.
So games from High Seas are out of question.

Then come some games which are delisted.
Please cast you vote on GOG Dreamlist to get them back!.

## I'm skipping

By default I skip sandbox games, because those tend to not have a story.
And I skip online games too, because Online & cannot speed run to complete.
I also skip card games, as they are too long.
The other games listed here are those I'm totally skipping.
