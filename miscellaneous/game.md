# My gamer side

I have played many games in my life, I admit it.
Fortunately I played brain developing games also!

I will be classifying them according to Platform/Store.
The list here shows only those which I have completed (Main game + DLCs).
Not what I own actually. That would be a very big list 😬.

There might be a case of games, which are endless in nature.
So I will try to mention them as well.
I'm skipping online games. They are naturally endless type.

I will try to mention the dates as well wherever possible.

### Optional Backlog

Most likely I won't be playing them, but would be nice to come back to.
Some games in this list are here due to me farming for steam trading cards.
I decided to finish them to avoid seeming like I played the game.

Additionally, there are many other games which have same reason,
but the ones mentioned here are specifically those which I liked and would play.

## Completed Games

`Included` = DLC play time is included in Main story play time.
The times are in `hhh:mm`.

Some games actually don't have a number in their title name,
like `Assassin's Creed 6: Unity`.
The numbers are put to match their release date.

Some of the games with start dates are determined from first achievement,
wherever it made sense.

## Unofficial

In other words, cracked games. I think they too deserve attention.
Those are also great games.
By default I will mention GOG, DRM free or Official Links if possible.
But in no way I will be mentioning any crack links.
Game Developers also need to earn money.
I didn't have any hence I resorted to cracks.
Considering my backlog of 1k+ games, I'm not buying new games.
So cracked games are out of question.

## I'm skipping

By default I skip sandbox games, because those tend to not have a story.
And I skip online games too, because Online & cannot speed run to complete.
I also skip card games, as they are too long.
The other games listed here are those I'm totally skipping.
