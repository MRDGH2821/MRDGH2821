# My gamer side

I have played many games in my life, I admit it.
Fortunately I played brain developing games also!

I will be classifying them according to Platform/Store.
The list here shows only those which I have completed (Main game + DLCs).
Not what I own actually. That would be a very big list üò¨.

There might be a case of games, which are endless in nature.
So I will try to mention them as well.
I'm skipping online games. They are naturally endless type.

I will try to mention the dates as well wherever possible.

## On Going ~~Backlog~~

## Unofficial

In other words, cracked games. I think they too deserve attention.
Those are also great games. By default I will mention the official links.
Else EGS, Steam, GOG or DRM free version Links if possible.
But in no way I will be mentioning any crack links.
Game Developers also need to earn money.
I didn't have any hence I resorted to cracks.
Considering my backlog of 1k+ games, I'm not buying new games.
So cracked games are out of question.

## I'm skipping

By default I skip sandbox games, because those tend to not have a story.
And I skip online games too, because Online & cannot speed run to complete.
I also skip card games, as they are too long.
The other games listed here are those I'm totally skipping.
