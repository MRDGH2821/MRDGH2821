### Brief Info About myself

Greetings, I'm Mihir Rabade.
I'm an Introvert & an enthusiast about technology, especially in Gaming sector.
Earlier I was more fascinated about front end of things.
But once I went behind the scenes, I became interested in Game Development.
I also have a huge tendency to apply the knowledge I learnt.
